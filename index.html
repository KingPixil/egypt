                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">All about the geography of Egypt.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/geography.jpg" alt="A river in Egypt.">
                            <p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geography was a very important part of Egyptian society, and was necessary in developing civilizations. One key geographical feature is the Nile River. This river was and still maintains the position of the longest river in the world. To get an idea of how large it is, imagine a river stretching from Central Africa, through Egypt and ending in the Mediterranean Sea. That is 4,000 miles! On the other hand, Egypt's civilizations grew along a 750 mile chunk of the river. Also, similar to Mesopotamia, Egypt was divided into two regions, the southern one being Upper Egypt, and the Northern one being Lower Egypt. This is because the river flowed from southern Egypt into the Mediterranean Sea, which is in the north. So the river flows from Upper to Lower Egypt! As the Nile river cut through the deserts, it created fertile land in a river valley. With this, Upper Egypt had rocky terrain, filled with hills. This led to <b>cataracts</b> developing in the river. In lower Egypt, the Nile river emptied into the Mediterranean Sea via a <b>delta.</b> A delta is a triangle shaped chunk of land that is made when soil is deposited by a river.
                                <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, much like other deserts, Egypt received little to no rain. Luckily, an annual rainfall came in the highlands of Africa, and these caused the Nile River to flood! Just like in Mesopotamia, this would bring silt to the land, making the land in the river valley a dark color. Meanwhile, the rest of Ancient Egypt was referred to as the red land.
                                <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, the Nile River played a very important role in the development of Egypt.

                            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the water and fertile land given by the Nile River, farms developed into small villages, and these villages developed into cities! This happened when hunter-gatherers made farms along the river valley. Soon, in 4500 BC, these farms developed into villages. These villages had agricultural techniques which, unlike Mesopotamia, didn’t use basins to store water. Instead, they just used canals to bring the flow of the water to their farms. With this, Egypt had developed a food surplus. Egypt also had another advantage - it had natural barriers such as a desert, the Mediterranean Sea, and cataracts. With the upper hand, Egypt’s villages began to build up. Any farmer that was wealthy would become the leader of that village. By the time it was 3200 BC, the villages had been converted into two colossal kingdoms. One in Upper Egypt and one in Lower Egypt. The two kingdoms had centers of their power, these were their capitals. The capital of Lower Egypt was Pe, and the capital of Upper Egypt was called Nekhen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 3100 BC, <b>Menes</b> had power in Upper Egypt. Although researchers still debate on whether or not his accomplishments were his own, or from other kings. Nevertheless, Menes wanted to control both Upper and Lower Egypt. While he was controlling Upper Egypt, his army invaded lower, and to increase his power even more, he married a princess from Lower Egypt. Soon, he had a double crown. Menes became Egypt’s first <b>pharaoh.</b> He also was the maker of Egypt’s First <b>Dynasty.</b> During his rule, Menes created a city named Memphis. This was the political center of Egypt for centuries to come.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Dynasty then lasted for another 200 years, before being taken over by the founders of the Second Dynasty.

                            <h2>RELIGION/SOCIAL/POLITICAL ORDER</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">All about the authority!</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/mummies.jpg" alt="">
                            <p align="left">
                            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about four centuries, the first and second dynasties fell. But at around 2700 BC, a Third Dynasty rose. This marked the epoch of time known as the <b>Old Kingdom.</b> This period of time lasted from 2700 BC to 2200 BC, while Egyptians were developing their political system. This system declared that a pharaoh was both a king and a god. The most well known pharaoh of the Old Kingdom was <b>Khufu.</b> He had many gorgeous monuments built for him. Just like in Mesopotamia, when Egypt had 2 million people at the end of the Old Kingdom, it developed a social hierarchy. At the top of this hierarchy was a pharaoh, below the pharaoh were <b>nobles,</b> who helped run the government, and temples. Next came the middle class, which included scribes and crafts people. There was a fair amount of these people. Last came the lower class, this was 80 percent of the whole population! They included farmers, servants, and slaves. When society was still developing, Egypt began to implement trade. With this, Egypt also became a highly religious place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egyptians perspective of religion extended beyond a person’s death, as many traditions focused on life after death. Egyptians practiced polytheism. To worship the different gods, Egyptians built temples. The Egyptians had many gods, some of them being:
                            </p>
                            
<ul align="left">
<li>Re</li>
<li>Osiris</li>
<li>Isis</li>
<li>Horus</li>
<li>Thoth</li>
<li>Geb</li>
</ul>
                            <p align="left">
Egyptian religion was heavily based on the <b>afterlife.</b> Egyptians believed that a Ka was a person's life force. This would leave the body after death and become a spirit. It also had the same basic needs as a person. such as food, rest, and entertainment. People needed to fill tombs with objects for the ka so that the ka’s needs would be fulfilled. A body also had requirements, if it was decayed, then a spirit will not recognize it, so Egyptians used a technique called embalming to preserve the dead bodies. These were <b>mummies.</b> <br>The embalming process went like this:
                            </p>
<ol align="left">
<li>Remove all organs except for heart.</li>
<li>Put organs inside a jar.</li>
<li>Dry out the body then apply oils.</li>
<li>Wrapped with linen cloths.</li>
<li>Place mummy in coffin</li>
</ol>
                            <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, only royal and other <b>elite</b> people could afford mummies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egyptians also believed that tombs were important, especially ones for royal people. This led them to build <b>pyramids</b> as tombs. Many are still standing to this date. They had a point facing up to have a pathway to the afterlife. This shows how advanced Egyptians were in <b>engineering.</b> Still, there is debate on how Egyptians built these spectacular pyramids. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, religion was a very important part of Egypt’s social and political order, because of Egyptians high religious belief.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Achievments of Egyptians!</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/temple.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egyptians are still known for their advanced skills in architecture. You have probably heard of the pyramids. Other than that, Egyptians also built huge temples, these temples were where the gods lived. On the path leading to the temple, there was a row of <b>sphinxes.</b> A sphinx is an imaginary creature with a body of a lion and a head of an animal or human. On the sides of the gates were an <b>obelisk.</b> One example of an obelisk is the Washington Monument. When you go inside, everything his decorated and filled with colorful pictures of pharaohs and writing. One great temple is the Temple of Karnak. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art was also very important in Ancient Egypt. There were many colorful paintings. These paintings were painted on temples and tombs. To paint, Egyptians practice a form of art called frontalism. Frontalism is when the head of a character is facing the side, while the body remains facing the viewer. It was extremely hard to draw people this way. Unfortunately, only important people could see paintings. Egyptian art also included carving and jewelry. Many tombs and temples had statues that were highly precise in detail. Also, Egyptians made jewelry out of precious stones. Sadly, tomb raiders have taken many from tombs today. One remains that was not disturbed. It belonged to <b>King Tutankhamen.</b> Since it was not disturbed, scientists can see what Egyptian burial practices were like.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were an Ancient Egyptian, you could probably understand Egyptian <b>hieroglyphics.</b> These were a set of symbols representing something, and there were more than 600 symbols! Hieroglyphics were also one of the world’s first writing systems. They were written on <b>papyrus.</b> Papyrus was a paper-like material made from seeds. Scribes would use papyrus to write on, and would write on papyrus using brushes and ink. Because of the fact that hieroglyphics could be written horizontally or vertically, it made it hard to read. Papyrus was also very long-lasting and didn’t decay in Egypt’s dry climate, with this, many Egyptian texts and literature have survived. How do we know all of this? In 1799, a french soldier found a special stone slab that had hieroglyphics, it also had greek text. Since all of the text in it was the same, historians could figure out what the hieroglyphics translated to! This was called the <b>Rosetta Stone.</b>

                            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the end of the Old Kingdom, the amount of power that was in the Pharaoh’s hands was taken away. After 2200 BC, the Old Kingdom had ended, and nobles were ruling most cities for 160 more years to come. Then came the <b>Middle Kingdom.</b> This was a time of stability and peace. Soon, a group known as the Hyksos invaded Lower Egypt, and ruled as Pharaohs there. After the Egyptians fought back, a person from Thebes known as Ahmose declared himself king. He drove the Hyksos out of Egypt, and ruled over Egypt as a whole. This marked the beginning of Egypt's eighteenth dynasty.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it was the start of the <b>New Kingdom.</b> Egypt then began to build an empire, in fear of further attacks.This allowed the Egyptian traders to expand their trading across more distant lands. This was mainly because of a key leader in Ancient Egypt: <b>Queen Hatshepsut.</b> She was married to her half-brother, King Thutmose Ⅱ. After he died, the throne went to Thutmose Ⅲ. But because of the fact that he was too young, Queen Hatshepsut took rule. She was known to dress herself up as a man to hide the fact that she was a woman. This is the result of people thinking that woman should not rule. She was heavily focused on increasing Egypt’s trade, because she sent traders south to trade with people in the kingdom of Punt, and north to trade with Asia Minor and Greece. Many profitable <b>trade routes</b> began to appear. This money was important for Egypt’s art and architecture, which will be explained more thoroughly in the Egyptian Achievements section. But, Queen Hatshepsut was known for many monuments built for her. Still, despite all of Egypt’s effort in keeping them safe from invasions, many armies stood to challenge Egypt. One of these groups being Hittites. They were fought by a pharaoh known as <b>Ramses The Great.</b> Ramses was a fierce military leader, and fought against the Hittites for years without giving up. He was greatly outnumbered, but he did not admit defeat and went on to fight. Unfortunately, neither side could defeat the other. Still, this was only one group, other armies such as Tehenu also threatened Egypt. Ramses was so important, that after he died, people known as the Sea Peoples destroyed the Hittites and fought cities in Southwest Asia. After 50 years of fighting and war, Egypt managed to get them to stop. After this, Egypt’s empire that controlled Asia fell, and then the New Kingdom ended. After the New Kingdom, Egypt began a period of time where it was filled with violence and disorder on the streets. After these invasions, Egypt would never get back on its own two feet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Egypt, the life stayed the same as the jobs, which included scribes, artisans, artists, architects, merchants, traders, soldiers, farmers, peasants, and slaves. There was a small amount of traders, even though trade was very essential in Egypt. Speaking of trade, why was it so essential? Trade was important to Egypt because they could gain valuable resources, and even earn money! With all of this money and wealth, Egypt could do extra things, and invest in arts and architecture. In the Eastern Mediterranean, trade was growing rapidly, and Egypt was gaining timber and copper. In the Nile Valley, Egypt was gaining gold, copper, and timber! With this, Egypt could get wealth and resources. Queen Hatshepsut was the one who worked to increase trade, and it worked! Egypt became wealthy and began to invest in things such as art and architecture.
